### **About Me**

I graduated from law university.
I donâ€™t know how to do IT work, but I try to independently find out the basics of developing web add-ons for the help of various Internet courses. On the other hand, I may have some knowledge and skills in programming (HTML, CSS, JS), but I also have knowledge and system for independent work. At the right time, I speak English language (the ribs of the English language are sufficient for oral and written communication).
